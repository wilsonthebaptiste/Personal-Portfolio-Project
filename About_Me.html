            <li>The start of my professional journey began by applying theoretical concepts to real-world applications through an impactful internship at NASA-JPL. There, I engaged in pioneering research, investigating the interfacial behavior of amino acids on gold surfaces. </li>
            <li>The next step in my journey led me to an internship at NASA-Goddard where I worked on building a database of potential surface materials on the icy moon, Ceres. This was also during the lockdown period and it resulted in a lot of personal development navigating through such unique circumstances.</li>
            <li>My first "true" career experience was as a Process Engineer at Plug Power where my role centered around optimizing hydrogen fuel distribution systems through meticulous design and standardization of process instrumentation diagrams. My contributions supported initiatives to make hydrogen fuel more accessible and safe for users.</li>

            <p> As a former player myself, I'm a passionate individual who thrives on the exhilarating competition of football. My love for football isn't just about the sport itself; it's about the unity, the strategy, and the sheer unpredictability of each game. There is beauty in gathering people from so many different walks of life and unifying them towards a single goal despite how grueling the road might be.</p>
            <p>As a big fan of creativity, stories and art have always held a special place in my heart. They're not just hobbies; they're gateways to other worlds, emotions, and perspectives. From the stroke of a paintbrush to the turn of a page, I find joy in the creative expression and the endless possibilities they bring.</p>
            <p>Video games are my go-to escape, offering both a challenge to my problem-solving skills and an artistic narrative that captivates my imagination. They're not just games; they're experiences that combine all my passions into interactive adventures, where I can explore, learn, and grow.</p>
            <p>Spending quality time with the people I care about is my anchor. Whether it's a football game, a gaming session, or just a quiet evening sharing stories, these moments are what I cherish the most. They remind me of the beauty in connections and the shared experiences that weave the fabric of our relationships.</p>
